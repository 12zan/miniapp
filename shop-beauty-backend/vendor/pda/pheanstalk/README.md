Pheanstalk
==========

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pda/pheanstalk.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pda/pheanstalk)

Pheanstalk is a pure PHP 5.3+ client for the [beanstalkd workqueue][1].  It has
been actively developed, and used in production by many, since late 2008.

Created by [Paul Annesley][2], Pheanstalk is rigorously unit tested and written
using encapsulated, maintainable object oriented design.  Community feedback,
bug reports and patches has led to a stable 1.0 release in 2010, a 2.0 release
in 2013, and a 3.0 release in 2014.

Pheanstalk 3.0 introduces PHP namespaces, PSR-1 and PSR-2 coding standards,
and PSR-4 autoloader standard.

beanstalkd up to the latest version 1.4 is supported.  All commands and
responses specified in the [protocol documentation][3] for beanstalkd 1.3 are
implemented.

Installation with Composer
-------------

Install pheanstalk as a dependency with composer:

```bash
composer require pda/pheanstalk
```


Usage Example
-------------

```php
<?php

// Hopefully you're using Composer autoloading.

use Pheanstalk\Pheanstalk;

$pheanstalk = new Pheanstalk('127.0.0.1');

// ----------------------------------------
// producer (queues jobs)

$pheanstalk
  ->useTube('testtube')
  ->put("job payload goes here\n");

// ----------------------------------------
// worker (performs jobs)

$job = $pheanstalk
  ->watch('testtube')
  ->ignore('default')
  ->reserve();

echo $job->getData();

$pheanstalk->delete($job);

// ----------------------------------------
// check server availability

$pheanstalk->getConnection()->isServiceListening(); // true or false

```


Running the tests
-----------------

There is a section of the test suite which depends on a running beanstalkd
at 127.0.0.1:11300, which was previously opt-in via `--with-server`.
Since porting to PHPUnit, all tests are run at once. Feel free to submit
a pull request to rectify this.

```
